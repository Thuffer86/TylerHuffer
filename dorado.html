          <h2>Dorado Resteraunte</h2>
          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
          <p>Dorado Resteraunte was made for a local client in October of 2017. The website was created using Bootstrap and during the process I was able to polish up on new bootstrap features. My happy client wanted a website that promoted his business and displayed an extensive menu. I even helped tutor him on how he would be able to update his menu prices in the future so that he could have independent control of his website. </p>
</br>
          <p>I enjoy working with clients like Roger because of his long time experience as a restaurant owner, he was able to guide the design process by helping me to understand who his typical customer and ultimately the audience to his website will be. We were both excited to the least when we launched the site.</p>
